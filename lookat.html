It was so refreshing to have a different kind of suffering to concentrate on, for once. It seems to me that physical pain is often more bearable than emotional pain. Because it's simple, straight-forward, instinctive; it doesn't have to do with your own mind, it doesn't need fancy metaphors to be explained, everybody gets it. With each radiating wave of hurt, the pain finds both its manifestation and its outlet. It ‘‘makes sense’’, it's self-evident, it's grounding. Emotional distress is often hazy and confused, with strings of conflicting thoughts and feelings crossing and tangling and still adding to each other, rather than ever cancelling each other out; but the bleeding of a flesh wound speaks plainly: “grit your teeth, get some rest, you’ll feel better eventually”.";

I wanted it to feel visceral and nearly gross, and so the heart is meaty, the fingers are flexed, and the blood is rich. I tried to obtain as realistic a material rendering as I could. I wanted the image of tearing and puncturing, so the claws were essential - hence why it is undeniably a “furry anthro” piece. The composition as a whole, though - especially in regards to the background decorations - was loosely envisioned as a hypothetical album cover.";

The kind of pain you can’t do anything about, or that you have surrendered to, for you no longer have the energy to fight against.
