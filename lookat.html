              document.getElementById("comment2").textContent = "Something I found out in 2025 is that I actually really like The Simpsons, at least the earlier seasons. I was never much of a fan growing up, I’d only ever seen the occasional episode on TV now and then, and like a lot of people I simply acknowledged it as one of the many overplayed properties that is, by now, more brand than show. However I was intrigued by short clips from some “Golden Age” episodes I stumbled upon, and considering the heartfelt praise I’d repeatedly heard about that set of seasons, I decided to give it a proper shot. Expectedly, I was quickly won over. The creativity and sheer density of the humour is seriously impressive – maybe I don’t watch enough comedy series, but never before has a show forced me to pause in order to catch my breath after a string of jokes. There is something strangely compelling about nearly all named characters, be it some peculiar quirk, a recurring joke, or their unexplainably charming voice acting. The cel animation and soft colour palette add a layer of intense and pervasive cosiness, making the environments feel deeply welcoming and immediately familiar. And sometimes, it treats you to perfect little moments of genuine heart. Given all this, it’s very easy to fall a bit in love with this universe.";
              document.getElementById("comment3").textContent = "This newfound fascination of mine eventually reawakened the long-dormant memory of the strange phenomenon of Simpsonwave. Back in early high school, I’d developed a fixation for the collection of “vibe-centric” musical and visual art movements that could be grouped under the Vaporwave label, and Simpsonwave was one specific little niche I somehow ended up appreciating for a short while. In revisiting a few of those iconic Simpsonwave works I could remember, I dusted off a certain intrigue that, indeed, I no longer experience towards the broader Vaporwave movement – there really is something about that shamelessly nostalgic, highly dramatic, vaguely ironic (?) take on The Simpsons as a sort of popular memory, twisted and recontextualised into something more yet fragmented and incoherent.";
              document.getElementById("comment4").textContent = "It’s fitting, considering that the show is still being produced, uncountable years beyond its time, regardless of how “off” it may all feel today. And more fitting still, that I made this rediscovery during a period where my usual anxiety about the passage of time and ultimate inevitable death was remarkably intense. This whole little personal journey felt too significant to ignore, the timing and the interweaving themes of nostalgia and immortality, of rediscovery and predestination, of sweet comfort and visceral terror too interesting not to comment on. And alongside all that was a strong desire for escapism. And so I thought, you know what? Maybe Simpsonwave is worth some genuine appreciation after all, even if only in the context of my personal experience.";
              document.getElementById("comment5").textContent = "Kit takes centre stage because of his association with change. The reflection portrays his original design, from my middle school days, when he was a much more lighthearted and mischievous character. Coincidentally, his colours are also pretty fitting for the theme. The background is a reference to the classic Ｓｉｍｐｓｏｎｗａｖｅ １９９５ music video by FrankJavCee, and to more general Simpsonwave tropes such as masked superimposed images, a heavy VHS filter, and fake distortion effects. Milhouse and Nelson allude to ＴＨＲＩＬＬＨＯＵＳＥ by Lucien Hughes (or, the haunting “There stands a broken man” clip itself) and the iconic Simpsons Resonance Vine, respectively, two of my favourite and most poignant works of Simpsonwave. The character atop the grandfather clock is Caesarus, a design I toyed around with way back when, who was literally just supposed to be a consolidation of Vaporwave into something I could doodle. I had a LOT of fun with this piece, since it required me to experiment with effects I wouldn’t normally use. The tones were chosen so as to replicate the look of cel animation. To that end I also went for flat colours and a prominent undershadow to the characters. The blur, chromatic aberration, and grain were later added using Gimp.";
              document.getElementById("comment6").textContent = "An additional word on the song Simpsonwave 1995, which has always been a favourite of mine (yes, even over HOME’s Resonance). It’s crazy to think that it was created ironically, to poke fun at the homonymous movement, when it actually embodies the height of the genre. It captures exactly the feeling people loved about it. It’s so tragic, so foreboding, and I especially like it because I feel it’s a mean song. It’s not a reminder of the sweetness of times gone, but of the terrifying indifference of the steadily marching clock.";

It was so refreshing to have a different kind of suffering to concentrate on, for once. It seems to me that physical pain is often more bearable than emotional pain. Because it's simple, straight-forward, instinctive; it doesn't have to do with your own mind, it doesn't need fancy metaphors to be explained, everybody gets it. With each radiating wave of hurt, the pain finds both its manifestation and its outlet. It ‘‘makes sense’’, it's self–evident, it's grounding. Emotional distress is often hazy and confused, with strings of conflicting thoughts and feelings crossing and tangling and still adding to each other, rather than ever cancelling each other out; but the bleeding of a flesh wound speaks plainly: “grit your teeth, get some rest, you’ll feel better eventually”.";
